# TimeManagmentProject
it's my first pet-project, app for time managment and self-discipline for android
ToDo: 
- ~~fill themes page with 2-3 workable themes~~
- ~~fix changable title while swithing to different pages~~
- Add page for adding activities and make dynamic activities
Working with app is stopped cause i want rewrite it in Kotlin.
